hyperspectral-section
=====================

A visualization tool for exploring hyperspectral images.  The provides a method
for mapping image intensities along a user-drawn path in spatial coordinates.
This works with all formats supported by GDAL.  This has been successfully
tested on Mac OS 10.6 and Debian-flavored linux.  This depends on Qt 4, GDAL
1.7, and Qwt 5.2.  Other versions of these libraries may work, but they are
untested.  This is released under the MIT license.  Any comments can be
